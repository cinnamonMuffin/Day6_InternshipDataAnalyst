# Day6_InternshipDataAnalyst


This was a pretty straightforward task. The script contains code that uses the strftime function to extract the day, month and year from Order_Date and set it as Month, sum of Sales and set it as Revenue, count of distinct Order_ID and sets it as Order_Volume.
I used the superstore dataset renaned as orders.csv (attached)
The data is also grouped and ordered by month and uses only data from the year 2022.

Thank You
